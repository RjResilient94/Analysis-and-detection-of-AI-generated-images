# Project Title – Analysis and detection of images generated by AI mmodels

## 🧠 Overview
Images generated by Artificial Intelligence models are increasingly difficult due to various factors. This project aims to identify such images and study their analytical features using transforms to train a model and apply generalisation on it to train other models as well
